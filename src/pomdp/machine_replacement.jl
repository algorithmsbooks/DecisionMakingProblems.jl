# From Smallwood and Sondik, 1973
# 3 states       - 0, 1 or 2 faulty internal components
# 4 actions
#    - manufacture without examination (M)
#    - manufacture with examination (E)
#    - interrupt the line and replace failed components (I)
#    - interrupt the line and replace both components without inspection (R)
# 2 observations - defective product or not
#
# NOTE: The original paper includes "salvage values", or terminal rewards
#       equal to the number of working parts. We do not include that here.

# Component breakdowns are independent
# 10% probability that either breaks down during the manufacture of a product
# Failed components cause 50% of part being defective
