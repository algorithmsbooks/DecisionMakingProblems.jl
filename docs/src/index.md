# [DecisionMakingProblems.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPOMDP/POMDPs.jl)
*A Julia interface to access MDP and POMDP models which appeared in Algorithms for Decision Making.*

## Available Packages

The POMDPs.jl package contains the interface used for accessing Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially
observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) in the Julia programming language.
